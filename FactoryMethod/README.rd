Factory Method Design Pattern

Task: 
Create a program that generates random shapes (e.g. circles and rectangles). 
Implement the Factory Method pattern to encapsulate the creation of each shape in a separate class, 
and allow users to specify the type of shape they want to generate at runtime. 


Use console output to display the properties of each generated shape.
