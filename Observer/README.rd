Observer Design Pattern

Task: 
Create a program that simulates a traffic light. 
Implement the Observer pattern to allow multiple traffic lights to receive notifications whenever the state of the traffic light changes (e.g. from red to green). 

Use console output to display the current state of the traffic light.
